                Food insecurity is a significant challenge in Kenya, impacting millions of people despite the presence of numerous food banks and shelters. The lack of a centralized platform to coordinate food donations results in inefficiencies and underutilization of resources. Currently, donors and volunteers face difficulties in finding reliable information on how and where to contribute, leading to missed opportunities for assistance. Previous efforts have not fully resolved these issues, leaving a gap that this project aims to fill.
